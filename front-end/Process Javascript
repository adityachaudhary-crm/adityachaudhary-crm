How is Javscript processed by Javascript Engine? 

. Function Representation in Memory
When a JavaScript function is defined, the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome) goes through the following steps:

Step 1: Parsing
The engine reads the source code (as text) and parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
The AST is a structured representation of the code's syntax.
Step 2: Compilation
The engine compiles the function into bytecode (a lower-level representation optimized for execution).
Bytecode is not human-readable text but an intermediate representation understood by the JavaScript engine's interpreter or JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
Step 3: Function Object
A function object is created in memory, which contains:
A reference to the compiled bytecode (the actual instructions to execute the function).
Metadata about the function, such as its name, number of arguments, default values, closures, and the lexical environment in which it was defined.

2. How Is the Function Stored in Memory?
In memory, the function exists as a data structure. For example:

Text of the Function:

This is only retained as metadata, typically for debugging purposes or when you explicitly call .toString() on the function.
Compiled Code:

The actual instructions to execute the function are stored in the engine's memory as bytecode, ready for interpretation or optimization by the JIT compiler.

3. Example: Function in Source Code and Memory
Source Code:
javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
In Memory (Conceptual Representation):
Function Metadata:

Name: add
Parameters: a, b
Lexical Environment: Scope where add was declared
Reference to Bytecode: Points to compiled instructions
Compiled Instructions (Bytecode):

The engine compiles the add function into bytecode like:
css
Copy code
LOAD a
LOAD b
ADD
RETURN
This bytecode is stored in memory and executed when the function is called.
4. Can We Retrieve the Function Text?
If you want to see the text representation of a function, JavaScript provides the .toString() method:

Example:
javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

console.log(add.toString());
Output:

javascript
Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
This text is primarily stored for debugging or introspection purposes, but the actual execution uses the compiled bytecode.
5. Why Not Store Functions as Text?
Storing functions as plain text is inefficient for execution because:

Text Requires Reinterpretation:
Each time the function is called, the engine would need to re-parse and re-interpret the text, which would be slow.
Compiled Code Is Faster:
Bytecode is much more efficient for execution because it is closer to machine code and optimized for the engine's interpreter.
6. Under the Hood: JavaScript Engines
Modern JavaScript engines like V8 use a combination of interpreters and JIT compilers to execute functions:

Initially, the engine interprets the bytecode to execute the function quickly.
Frequently called functions (hot code) are further optimized into machine code for better performance.
Summary
In memory:

A function is not stored as plain text but as a compiled bytecode representation along with metadata.
The text of the function may still be available for introspection (e.g., using .toString()), but it is not used during execution.
This approach allows JavaScript engines to optimize function execution for speed and efficiency.



1. JavaScript Engine in the Browser Runtime
The JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox) is responsible for executing JavaScript code.
However, the JavaScript engine by itself only understands and executes core JavaScript features, as defined by the ECMAScript standard.
2. Browser Runtime
The browser runtime is the complete environment provided by a web browser to run web applications. It includes:

The JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code.
A set of APIs and objects specific to web development, such as:
The DOM API (document, window, element.addEventListener(), etc.).
Browser-specific APIs (fetch, localStorage, console.log, etc.).
Rendering engines (e.g., Blink for Chrome) to display the webpage.
